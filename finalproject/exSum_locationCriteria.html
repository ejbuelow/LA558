	<h1>Location Criteria</h1>
	


	<p>Comparing and ranking of the in-scope markets, we have used our expertise and experience to determine the necessary qualities for a successful parking lot. We have created a systematic approach to determining the best location for a parking lot of your choice. Park nâ€™ Lot, LLC and our client have worked together to create the criteria for our decision making process. 
<br></br>
Below is a diagram that breaks down the different In-Scope markets of interest into a weighting system that allows the client to make a knowledgeable decision about their new partnership. The criteria are specific to parking lots, as well as selling the property in the future for maximum revenue.
