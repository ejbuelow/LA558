  	<h3>Project Approach</h3>
  	<p>The three candidate locations are as follows: Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX; Fargo, ND/MD, and Bend, OR were all assessed from an Economic and Non-Economic perspective.</p>
<p>•	Economic: Cost of operating the parking lot considering the recurring costs of labor and real estate.</p>
<p>•	Non-Economic: Desirability of the prevailing business climate including the ability to scale and sustain operations.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>  
	<h3>In-Scope Markets</h3>
	<p>Comparing and ranking of the in-scope markets, we have used our expertise and experience to determine the necessary qualities for a successful parking lot. We have created a systematic approach to determining the best location for a parking lot of your choice. Park n’ Lot, LLC and our client have worked together to create the criteria for our decision making process. 
	<br></br>
Below is a diagram that breaks down the different In-Scope markets of interest into a weighting system that allows the client to make a knowledgeable decision about their new partnership. The criteria are specific to parking lots, as well as selling the property in the future for maximum revenue. </p>
<br></br>
<br></br> 
	<h3>Results and Recommendations</h3>
	<p>The graphic illustrates the trade-offs to be made for each location from economic and non-economic perspectives.  Top performing locations are found in the upper right quadrant.</p>

	<h3>Recommendations & Next Steps</h3>
	<p>Summary of each of the candidate locations	FINAL GRADING %</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Scalability: These markets scored best from a scalability perspective.  Albuquerque is the largest candidate market in terms of target job skills and demographic.  Colorado Springs offers the optimal concentration of target job skills aligned with the U.S. average and largest target demographic concentration reflecting a workforce and population aligned with Emerald’s requirements.
	<br></br>
	<p>Sustainability: Both markets performed well on sustainability measures and displayed a decrease in customer service wages over the past three years indicating a controlled cost environment.  Albuquerque displays the highest bilingual workforce indicators and Colorado Springs offers positive, but controlled growth of target job skills.<p/>
	<br></br>
	<p>Business Environment: Albuquerque and Colorado Springs both currently have 10+ available real estate options that meet Emerald’s requirements.  There are nonstop flights (though limited availability) to Atlanta from both top performing markets.  Albuquerque scored highest from an incentives perspective as a result of the large grant awards available in New Mexico.</p>
